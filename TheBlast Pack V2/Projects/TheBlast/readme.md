# TheBlast Updated Version 2

This is the second version (second remake) I'm working on. The first was so much fun to do, but it has some huge blocks of code I don't really liked.
This time I'm doing it faster, easier and less memory and resources hungry.
I still coding with flexibility.

# Differences planned (being done):

- No Safer things and stuff. Be safe because it is naturally
- More direct things, less paths
- A better coding overall (namespaces were weird, now they are nicer)
- Smoother animations and stuff
- More flexible like less fixed timing stuff (like functions were before)
