# TheBlast Updated Version 2

This is the second version (second remake) I'm working on. The first was so much fun to do, but it has some huge blocks of code I don't really liked.
This time I am doing a simplified version that does the same and it is more to this game than a generic code that can work with any game. This one is gonna be more like fixed values and stuff.
I still coding with flexibility, but I am trying to do something less "universal".

# Differences planned (being done):

- No Safer things and stuff. Be safe because it is naturally
- More direct things, less paths
- A better coding overall (namespaces were weird, now they are nicer)
