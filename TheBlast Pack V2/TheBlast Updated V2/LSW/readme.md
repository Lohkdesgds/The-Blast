# What is this?

This is the main folder where I am working on. This stuff is more "flexible" because it is not exactly the game, but where the game is running on.
It might be useful somewhere else.

# Why?

I think a folder to most of the code that is not exactly fixed to the project is a good way to allow to export to other projects. That way I can just literally copy and paste, maybe just include from here, something like that.
The updates to this game would work with updates on another project, so I think that's a great thing to do.
